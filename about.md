<h1 class="font-cursive text-center">About Paolo's Pizza</h1>

<h2 class="font-cursive">Dear Customers,</h2>

Paolo's Pizza is a 'Micro-Pizzeria' based in Marple, in Greater Manchester.

We provide a delivery only service bringing restaurant quality Pizza direct to your door.

Our Pizzas are made in the traditional Neapolitan style, using only the finest, imported Italian ingredients and quality local produce. Just like in Italy, we cook at temperatures between 480 and 500 degrees centigrade, producing the telltale speckling of the crust, and it's delicious smoky flavour.

As a 'Micro-Pizzeria', we value quality over quantity, and our Pizzas are made from scratch every day, by hand. Our dough is made using authentic Italian methods and proves for a minimum of 9 hours (just like it would in a Pizzeria in Naples!) to produce the light chewy crust that is the hallmark of good Neapolitan Pizza.

We only make around 30 Pizzas a day (which is why we always recommend booking in advance to avoid disappointment!), but our aim is that every Pizza provides a genuine taste of Italy and is as good as you would get if you were on the Amalfi Coast!

So, when you can't go to the Pizzeria, let the Pizzeria come to you!
